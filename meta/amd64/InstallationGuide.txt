PFFW installation is very intuitive and easy, just follow the instructions on the screen and answer the questions asked. You are advised to accept the default answers to all the questions. In fact, the installation can be completed by accepting default answers all the way from the first question until the last. The only exceptions are network configuration, password setup, and installation disk selection.

Auto allocator will provide a partition layout recommended for your disk. Suggested partitioning should be suitable for most installations, simply accept it.

Make sure you configure two network interfaces. You will be asked to choose internal and external interfaces later on. You can configure the internal wifi interface in Host AP mode.

All of the install sets and software packages are selected by default, simply accept the selections.

If the installation script finds an already existing file which needs to be updated, it saves the old file as <filename>.orig.

Installation logs can be found under the /root directory.

You can access the web administration interface using the IP address of the system's internal interface you have selected during installation. You can log in to the system over ssh from internal network.

Web interface user names are admin and user. Both are set to the same password you provide during installation.
